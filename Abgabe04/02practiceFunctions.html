		<h1>practice: functions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Use the IIFE to make your script run in strict mode.</li>
			<li>Write a function-value that takes two arguments and returns the smaller one. Test numbers, strings and booleans.</li>
			<li>Write a recursive function-value which tests for even numbers.
				Do not use the modulo-operator. Instead assume the following: 0 is odd, 1 is even, any other number-2 will become odd or even.
				Test on negative numbers. Return true for even and false for odd.</li>
			<li>Write a function which takes two arguments: the first is a string, the second a letter.
				Test how many times the letter occurs within the string. Return the number.</li>
